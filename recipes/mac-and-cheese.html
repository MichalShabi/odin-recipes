        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>My favorite thing about this recipe is how easy and quick it is to throw together. 
            It’s ready in the same time it would take for you to make a box of regular mac and cheese!</p>
        <p>When I’m craving comfort food, I turn to a big bowl of noodles, and this plant based mac and cheese hits the spot. 
            The luscious sauce is oh-so-creamy, cheesy and mild with just a little tang. It’s sure to become a staple meal in your home!</p>

        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups raw cashews</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>▢1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 (7-oz) bag shredded vegan cheddar cheese</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven and prep – If planning on baking it with the breadcrumb topping, 
                preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a casserole dish (I used a 9×13 inch dish).</li>
            <li>Soak the cashews – Soften your cashews by covering them in boiling water for 5 minutes. 
                I do this by heating up water in my tea kettle, and then pouring the boiling water over the cashews in a large glass measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta – Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but do not overcook. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Blend cheese sauce – Drain the soaked cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews, 2 cups fresh water, lemon juice, 
                nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and bag of shredded cheese (if using) to a high powered blender and blend until very smooth.</li>
        </ol>
